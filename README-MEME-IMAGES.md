# Meme Template Images

To complete the setup of this project, you need to add meme template images to the `/public/memes/` directory.

## Required Images:

1. `drake.jpg` - Drake Hotline Bling meme
2. `distracted-boyfriend.jpg` - Distracted Boyfriend meme
3. `two-buttons.jpg` - Two Buttons meme
4. `change-my-mind.jpg` - Change My Mind meme
5. `expanding-brain.jpg` - Expanding Brain meme
6. `gru-plan.jpg` - Gru's Plan meme
7. `this-is-fine.jpg` - This Is Fine meme
8. `surprised-pikachu.jpg` - Surprised Pikachu meme

You can find these images on various meme template sites or use your own versions.

## Important Notes:

- Make sure these images are in JPG format and named exactly as listed above
- Ensure you have the rights to use these images or are using them under fair use
- For optimal display, use images with dimensions proportional to those specified in the memeTemplates.json file

If no images are available, the app will show the UI but won't be able to load the meme templates.
